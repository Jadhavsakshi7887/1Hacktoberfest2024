This Java file provides an implementation to reverse the elements of a stack using recursion. 
The stack data structure is commonly used in algorithms and applications, and reversing its order can be a crucial operation in many use cases.

Features:
Utilizes recursion to reverse the stack without using any auxiliary data structure (like another stack or array).
Maintains the original order of elements after reversal.
Efficient and easy-to-understand code, ideal for learners and developers working with stacks.
How It Works:

The function recursively pops elements from the stack until it becomes empty.
Each element is then inserted back in the stack in reverse order.
This file is a helpful utility for those working with stacks in their Java programs, especially in competitive programming or algorithm design.
